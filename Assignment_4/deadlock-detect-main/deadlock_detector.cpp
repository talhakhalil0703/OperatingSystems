/// parameter edges[] contains a list of request- and assignment- edges

/// You need to process edges[] one edge at a time, and run a deadlock
/// detection after each edge. As soon as you detect a deadlock, your function
/// needs to stop processing edges and return an instance of Result structure
/// with edge_index set to the index that caused the deadlock, and dl_procs set
/// to contain with names of processes that are in the deadlock.
///
/// To indicate no deadlock was detected after processing all edges, you must
/// return Result with edge_index = -1 and empty dl_procs[].
